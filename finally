YAY I DID IT!!! How to create a file on git and push it into a remote repo

1. i cloned the cautious-guacamole repo into a chosen local directory (use the cd command, and that opens a repo, which will be the local directory the remote directory gets cloned into)
2. used git clone <URL> to clone the github repo into my local repo. can easily copy/paste URL by navigating to the repo in github and clicking the clone/download button
3. used git status to look at the files now contained in my local repo
4. entered the cautious-guacamole repo by using the cd command
5. used touch <finally> and then touch <i-did-it> to create two new files within cautious-guacamole
6. used git add -A to add the new files into the index, which preps them to be committed
7. used git commit to commit the new changes made to cautious-guacamole
8. this brings up a window where you can type in a message describing the changes you made for the commit
9. after done typing your message, hit ESC and then type :wq to submit the message
10. now that the commit is done, you can push the commits into your remote repo on github
11. used git push origin master to push my commits.

im not totally sure of the <origin> and <master> commands. i know master is the branch i am pushing the commits into. what does origin mean?

Next things to practice::
try pushing commits into a different branch of cautious-guacamole
try creating a new branch within cautious guacamole using GIT and git checkout -b <branchname> command
delete files from different repos
practice this whole thing again
is there a way to edit text in here so that i can emphasize words or commands?

woohoo i did it!
